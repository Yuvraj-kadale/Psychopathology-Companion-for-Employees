# Psychopathology-Companion-for-Employees
This is an approach to develop psychopathology companion for employees. There are  existing solution for this problem, but the approach based on cloud makes it unique, secure, and easy to  access and much faster as compared to traditional computing techniques. This project is created on AWS  cloud that is used to access the emotion of employees in industries and send the data after processing to the HR department. After the comprehensive study of the implemented project, we found that the cloud-based system runs much faster as compared to the system that does processing in the userâ€™s computer. Further,  we noticed that the system is almost 100% accurate and has very low latency when we have sufficient  bandwidth and proper connectivity. (Bandwidth greater than 5MB/s)
